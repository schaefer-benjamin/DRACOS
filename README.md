DAMOSET (With data-driven modelling towards a successful energy transition) is funded within the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions under grant agreement No 840825 from June 2019 to May 2021.

## Project description

The power grid is an integral part of the power system. It connects all electrical consumers with generators and powers everything from household appliances to large factory machinery. Without this grid, farmers would not be able to feed their animals, car factories would come to a halt, mobile phone systems would fail and many of us would not even be able to make a cup of tea. While the current power system is very reliable and offers a high quality of service, it remains unclear how this will develop in the future. The limited supply of fossil fuels as well as the necessary reduction of CO2 emissions to mitigate climate change will eventually lead to a power grid mainly supplied by renewable generators, such as wind and solar plants. These plants output smaller total power so that a large number is necessary which have to be geographically distributed for optimal weather conditions. The current power grid system slowly emerged within several decades of optimization processes. However, now we are discussing how to revolutionize the whole energy system within years.

Therefore, a fundamental understanding of the current power system is necessary to develop potential pathways to a future 100% sustainable system. In this project, we use data-driven approaches to work towards a quantitative understanding of fluctuations in the power grid, as they are for example introduced by the changing demand or volatile energy generation. We aim to collect data and offer an open database of our measurements for the scientific community to analyse and to add to. In addition, we develop mathematical and computational tools to understand these measurements and eventually provide guidance to policy decisions.
