The project "Data-Driven Analysis of Complex Systems for a Sustainable Future (DRACOS)" is the basis for a Young Invesitigator Group (YIG) funded by the Helmholtz Association (grant no. VH-NG-1727) from January 2022 to December 2026. The project is lead by Benjamin Schäfer at the Institute for Automation and Applied Informatics (IAI) at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT).

## Group description

Can data-driven approaches help us understand complex systems, such as the energy system? How do we make machine descriptions of complex systems more transparent?
Our group combines data analysis, machine learning and physical modelling to understand complex systems, with an emphasis on the energy transition, sustainability and climate change. For example, consider the power grid frequency: Its fluctuations around 50Hz contain information about the balance of supply and demand in a given region. Using stochastic models, we can replicate its random behavior and compare it to the data analytics. Meanwhile, we can train machine learning models to forecast the frequency for the next hour, identifying which features critically determine the dynamics.
We believe a collaborative effort and transparency is necessary to successfully implement a transition towards a sustainable energy system. To ensure this transparency, we stress the need for open data and interpretable models.

## Recent Highlights

•	Open database analysis of scaling and spatio-temporal properties of power grid frequencies, Nature Communications 11, 2020. [Article link](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19732-7) [ArXiv link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.02481)  
Context: With this article, we establish an open data base for certain energy time series (power grid frequency) and show how data analytics can be used to understand complex systems, such as the energy system. In particular, we show how smaller energy systems are more volatile and how disturbances spread through a large network.

•	Revealing drivers and risks for power grid frequency stability with explainable AI, Patterns 2021, [Article link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666389921002270) [ArXiv link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04341)  
Context: We explore how the power grid can be understood using interpretable machine learning/explainable artificial intelligence. To this end, we developed a precise regression model for stability indicators of the power grid frequency and interpreted it in detail. Using Shapley additive explanations (SHAP), we identified how different power systems act slow and fast in the different synchronous areas and how forecast errors are particularly destabilizing the Nordic power systems. 

•	Non-Gaussian Power Grid Frequency Fluctuations Characterized by Lévy-stable Laws and Superstatistics, Nature Energy 3, 119-126, 2018. [Article link](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41560-017-0058-z) [ArXiv link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.08496)  
Context: This work represents the results of very fruitful interdisciplinary and international collaboration, involving a 2.5-month research stay in Japan and collaborations in London. Within the article, we present a collection of power grid frequency recordings, stochastically analyze these recordings and present a quantitative stochastic theory. Thereby, we revealed the impact of trading actions on the frequency statistics and predicted a dependency of the stability of the power grid as a function of the size.

•	Dynamically induced cascading failures in power grids, Nature Communication 9, 1975, 2018. [Article link](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04287-5) [ArXiv link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.08018)  
Context: In this article, we demonstrate how dynamical properties of the power grid essentially determine the potential damage caused by a single line failure in the grid. Furthermore, we propose a tractable predictor to identify critical infrastructure. Later this could be compared and combined with machine learning approaches.

•	Wind Power Persistence is Governed by Superstatistics, Scientific Reports 9, 19971, 2019 [Article link](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-56286-1) [ArXiv link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.06391)  
Context: Here. We investigate wind statistics in Europe, with a focus on long, persistent periods with very low wind velocity. To quantify risks of long periods without wind generation, we go beyond simple distributions and introduce a superstatistic distribution.
