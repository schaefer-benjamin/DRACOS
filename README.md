The project "Data-Driven Analysis of Complex Systems for a Sustainable Future (DRACOS)" is the basis for a Young Invesitigator Group (YIG) funded by the Helmholtz Association (grant no. VH-NG-1727) from January 2022 to December 2026. The project is lead by Benjamin Schäfer at the Institute for Automation and Applied Informatics (IAI) at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT).

## Group description

Can data-driven approaches help us understand complex systems, such as the energy system? How do we make machine descriptions of complex systems more transparent?
Our group combines data analysis, machine learning and physical modelling to understand complex systems, with an emphasis on the energy transition, sustainability and climate change. For example, consider the power grid frequency: Its fluctuations around 50Hz contain information about the balance of supply and demand in a given region. Using stochastic models, we can replicate its random behavior and compare it to the data analytics. Meanwhile, we can train machine learning models to forecast the frequency for the next hour, identifying which features critically determine the dynamics.
We believe a collaborative effort and transparency is necessary to successfully implement a transition towards a sustainable energy system. To ensure this transparency, we stress the need for open data and interpretable models.

We investigate wind statistics in Europe, with a focus on long, persistent periods with very low wind velocity. To quantify risks of long periods without wind generation, we go beyond simple distributions and introduce a superstatistic distribution.)
